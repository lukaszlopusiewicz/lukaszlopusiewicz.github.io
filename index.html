  <section><h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an Associate Professor (Warsaw, Poland) and Postdoctoral Researcher (Greifswald, Germany), as well as an interdisciplinary scientist with a strong focus on sustainable food biotechnology, fermentation processes, and bio-based packaging. I have led and contributed to multiple national (NCBR, NCN, regional funds) and EU-funded projects (Horizon 2020, Interreg), focusing on plant-based fermented products, antimicrobial packaging materials, and the valorization of agri-food by-products.</p>
<p><strong>My expertise includes:</strong><br>
- fermentation and biotransformation of plant materials (with particular focus on by-products),<br>
- natural food additives, medicinal plants, antimicrobial compounds, biofilm research,<br>
- functional polymer films and coatings,<br>
- advanced analytical techniques (HPLC, TLC, GC, MS, FTIR, Raman, microbiology),<br>
- and international research collaborations (DE, NL, PT, CZ, CHN, IND).</p>
<p>I have extensive experience working with industrial partners, particularly in applied research and product development. I have actively participated in numerous international industry-related events, scientific congresses, and conferences, where I have presented research findings, promoted science, and served as an invited expert.</p>
<p>I am also honored to serve as a Senior Fellow at the Alfried Krupp Wissenschaftskolleg, a prestigious recognition awarded to only a handful of researchers from over 100 global applicants. This opportunity enables me to carry out my research at the Institute of Pharmacy, in the Pharmaceutical Biology group led by Prof. Sebastian Günther, and to fully engage in the academic life of Greifswald – a renowned center of excellence in research and higher education. My research project focuses on the role of cellulose – the most abundant natural polymer – in modulating biofilm formation in multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli.</p>
<p>In 2024, I was listed among the Stanford/Elsevier Top 2% most cited scientists worldwide for the year 2023.</p>
<p>In parallel, I am actively involved in the scientific community as a member of several professional societies (including the American Society for Microbiology and the Polish Societies of Microbiologists and Food Technologists), editorial board member for international journals (Fermentation, Material Science Research India), and guest editor of multiple special issues focused on fermentation, biopolymers, and plant-based innovations.</p>
<p>I am passionate about the circular bioeconomy and the development of functional, clean-label food innovations. I am open to academic, industrial, and grant-based collaborations.</p>
